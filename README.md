## Introduction

In this project, we address the task of predicting forest cover types using machine learning techniques. Accurate prediction of forest cover types is essential for various applications, including ecological modeling, biodiversity conservation, and forest management.

We explore different machine learning algorithms and techniques to build models that can accurately classify the forest cover types based on input features such as elevation, slope, aspect, and soil types.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Forest Cover Type dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains cartographic variables (e.g., elevation, slope, aspect) and wilderness area and soil type attributes, which are used to predict the forest cover type.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/forest-cover-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd forest-cover-prediction
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open and execute the `Forest_Cover_Type_Prediction.ipynb` notebook.

## Results

We evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and XGBoost, on the Forest Cover Type dataset. We compare the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of each model to determine the most suitable algorithm for predicting forest cover types.
